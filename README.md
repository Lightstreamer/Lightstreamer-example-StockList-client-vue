<!-- START DESCRIPTION lightstreamer-example-stocklist-client-javascript-basic-stock-list-demo---vue-client -->

## Details

This demo displays real-time market data for ten stocks generated by a feed simulator and is based on [Basic Stock-List Demo](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-javascript#basic-stock-list-demo---html-client). <br>

This project uses the <b>Web Client SDK API for Lightstreamer</b> to handle the communications with Lightstreamer Server and uses <b>Vue.js</b> library to display the real-time data pushed by Lightstreamer Server.

The onItemUpdate callback, of a Lightstreamer Subscription, updates an object binded to a Vue.js component, which keeps in sync the real-time data with the DOM.

If you want to go deeper into Vue, check out the [Vue.js site](https://vuejs.org).

## Install

If you want to install a version of this demo pointing to your local Lightstreamer Server, follow these steps:

* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer - Stock- List Demo - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-Stocklist-adapter-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer Server instance. Please check out that project and follow the installation instructions provided with it.
* Launch Lightstreamer Server.
* Change the current directory to the location of the file `package.json` and issue the commands `npm install` (to install Vue libraries) and `npm run build` (to compile the files). Be sure to have installed [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can deploy this demo inside Lightstreamer internal web server or in any other web server.
If you choose the former, please create the folders `/pages/demos/[demo_name]` into your Lightstreamer server installation then copy the contents of the `dist` folder of this project there.

The client demos configuration assumes that Lightstreamer Server, Lightstreamer Adapters, and this client are launched on the same machine. If you need to target a different Lightstreamer server, please search for this line:
```js
this.client = new LightstreamerClient
```
in `App.vue` and change it accordingly.

The demo is now ready to be launched.
